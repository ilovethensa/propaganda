It is primarily intended for psychological operations (psyops) and should be used responsibly.

Features
- Account Creation: This project can create Reddit accounts without human intervention(with email verification).
- Automated Posting: It can post content to subreddits, making it suitable for psyops and other automated tasks.


Important Notes

- Shadowban Checks: This feature has not been implemented yet, so you may need to manually monitor for shadowbans.
- Proxy Rotation: You will likely need to frequently rotate proxies to avoid IP blocking by Reddit. Support for proxy rotation will be added soon.
